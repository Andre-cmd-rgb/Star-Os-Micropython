# Star Os for Micropython
Star Os is a simple "operating system" for microcontrollers to make apis
# Installation
just copy and paste the contents of main.py from this repo to the microcontroller's main.py file and it should setup and download everything automatically!
(it will ask your wifi ssid and password to download all the stuff it needs)
